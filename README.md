# Buckshot Roulette Archipelago 

this is the apworld code (and soon client + mod) for buckshot roulette support for archipelago

note: this version doesnt actually work were you to import it as it is right now, my current testing environment is a bit different. some imports will need to be adjusted (they are usually commented)

see the game rules in [Rules.md](https://github.com/FlamingOranges/BuckshotRouletteArchipelago/blob/main/Rules.md)


faq:
### does this work yet
i mean the apworld can make a game that the server can run. thats about it. there is no mod for the game or client yet

### what are the options
none yet. thats next

### where are the unit tests
lol

### where are the rest of the files
lol

### why is this organized so poorly
lol

### why are there so many weird random things
lol

### did you vibe code this
no

### then why is it so bad
i mostly just copied the examples from the docs and newly made apquest (literally dropped mid-development). i only have a rough idea of what im doing. ill get better. i also used trpg's ultrakill code as a reference in some points since i understand ultrakill (but i cant say the same for the code)


## Next:
- make options
- make client 
- make game mod (this part scares me)
- make tests (lol)

all work in this repository created by me (@FlamingOranges) unless otherwise noted
