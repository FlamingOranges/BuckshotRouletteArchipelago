# Rules

Here's how it currently works:

The game begins with 3 locations. These are the three rounds in the main game. Each round passed is a check.

The next layer of progression is found after you get the *Pills*. These will unlock double or nothing mode.

Double or nothing mode can be continued until a score of 500,000. You will need to find the ability to go further.

The game's victory condition is found at a score of 1 million.


## Progression

Two core progression items:
* Pills - Unlocks double or nothing mode
* Double or Nothing Level 2 - This raises the ceiling from 500k.

Additional progression items:
* "BurnerUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the burner phone.
* "AdrenalineUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull adrenaline.
* "MagnifyingUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the magnifying glass.
* "InverterUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the inverter.
* "BeerUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the beer.
* "CigarettesUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the cigarettes.
* "MedicineUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the medicine.
* "HandSawUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the hand saw.
* "HandcuffsUnlock" - Unlocks the ability to pull the handcuffs.

*Two* of these are required to access Double or Nothing Level 1 (the pills).
*Four* of these are required to access Double or Nothing Level 2.

Customization options will be added later to adjust these requirements
